## Overview

My research in Mechanical Engineering focuses on automotive thermal systems, particularly air conditioning and heat pump technologies. Through my Master's degree at Kocaeli University, Turkey, and continued research, I have developed expertise in thermodynamic analysis, refrigerant performance evaluation, and automotive system optimization.

## Research Focus Areas

### Automotive Air Conditioning Systems
- Performance evaluation of automotive AC and heat pump systems
- Comparative analysis of refrigerants (R1234yf vs R134a)
- Energy and exergy-based performance assessment
- Experimental testing and validation

### Refrigerant Technology
- Environmental impact assessment of alternative refrigerants
- R1234yf as a low-GWP alternative to R134a
- Performance characteristics under various ambient conditions
- System optimization for different refrigerants

### Thermodynamic Analysis
- Energy efficiency optimization
- Exergy analysis of thermal systems
- Heat transfer and fluid mechanics
- System modeling and simulation
